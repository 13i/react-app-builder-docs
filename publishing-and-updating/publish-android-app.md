Soon as you have your app.json file in place and you have installer expo cli, you are able to proceed with making your Android app. 

To make your Android app run 

```text
expo ba --no-publish
```

The console will ask you whether you want them to manage your android certificate, or you will provide them your own keystore certificate.  

[Here are docs by Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/distribution/building-standalone-apps/#if-you-choose-to-build-for-android).

Follow the onscreen instruction. In the end, you will get a link to your Android app. An **.apk** file.

Download this file on your computer.
